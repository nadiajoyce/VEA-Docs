### Goals Achieved ‚úÖ:
- Interview second shooters, editors, and any others I work with/for to ensure inclusive practices and the comfort/safety of all my clients.
- Client contracts to all include an Event Behavior and Liability clause
- Maintaining a vendor referral list that is made up of at least 50% underrepresented folks
- At least once a year, attend networking events focused on and/or hosted by underrepresented groups in order to connect with even more folks working in the wedding industry.


### Goals Missed/Needing Improvement üü°:
- Quarterly website audits
- Monthly social feed audits
- Minimum two paid workshops a year by/for underrepresented groups.
- Spend at least 50% directory advertising dollars with organizations that prove a commitment to D+I as a public part of their business practices and/or cater specifically to underrepresented groups

### Not Applicable/Didn't Come Up This Year ‚ö™:
- Before participation in any styled shoots, workshops, or other events, inquire into their own D+I policies.

### üü° Monthly Social Audits

After two years of failing this goal, it‚Äôs clear something needs to shift and I need to reassess what this looks like (or figure out another way to objectively track that my social feeds are remaining inclusive and representative). In all honesty, bookings were down significantly in 2023, and almost all my focus outside of existing client support was on trying to remedy quickly declining revenue. I don‚Äôt expect or plan to continue to have the same struggles long-term; however, it‚Äôs becoming increasingly clear that a shift in how I manage and prioritize my time and workflows is needed to ensure that regularly recurring D+I work is getting done. Part of this will involve me updating my goals for the 2024 season to ones that are not only more realistic in the context of my day-to-day and month-to-month work, but also meaningful (checking things off a list is not the same as incorporating impactful and meaningful processes and practices into the foundation of the other work I‚Äôm already doing).

### üü° Quarterly Website Audits

Basically, see above. Formal quarterly website audits also were sacrificed this past year in lieu of website updates that were mostly focused on problem solving for decreasing bookings and revenue. While D+I was paid attention to when updating items like images and copy on the site during these other changes, I did not conduct any official audits that were primarily focused on D+I.

### ‚úÖ Interviewing of Second Shooters + Other Subcontractors

Though I didn‚Äôt hire any new second shooters in 2023, I did plan and coordinate a styled shoot in April that required hiring a handful of other vendors (e.g. florist, HMUA, venue, models, etc). For that event, everyone was required to sign a contract and agree to D+I policies. Everyone also was individually vetted for the shoot, especially because the event was focused on highlighting LGBTQIA+ vendors and couples. 

Also, the florist I worked with on this styled shoot ended up being a short-term partner to some of my elopement packages. She provided florals for one of my couples in September. Before partnering, she signed an independent contractor agreement that included a D+I clause, and I also had had many extensive conversations with her about her values, making sure they aligned with Venture Ever After‚Äôs.

Lastly, I officially brought on an associate photographer in 2023. This is a person who had already worked as a second shooter for me for many years, and who had already completed my D+I interview questionnaire and signed both a second shooter and associate shoot contract that included D+I clauses.


### ‚úÖ Contract Clause

All VEA contracts (wedding, event, portrait, second shooter, etc) still include a clause which states:

_In the event that Photographer identifies any inappropriate, threatening, hostile, racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, misogynistic, or otherwise hateful or offensive behavior directed at them or their employees, contractors, agents, or other, Photographer reserves the right to end photography, retain all fees paid by the Client, and hold no further responsibilities to the Client._

_Photographer agrees to notify the Client of any of the above listed behaviors, and give them an opportunity to correct such behaviors, or remove the offending individuals from the session prior to ending photography_

### üü° Two Paid Workshops a Year

As already mentioned, 2023 was a very rough year for booking and revenue. I only purchased one piece of continuing education, and it was focused on trying to resolve the problem of low inquiries/bookings. I simply did not have the funds to purchase more education this year.

### ‚ö™ Inclusive Practices for Workshops, Styled Shoots, etc

I actually didn‚Äôt attend any styled shoots or workshops in 2023, aside from the one that I myself coordinated (which doesn‚Äôt count here). So, this goal ended up being a ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù for 2023.

### ‚úÖ Vendor Referral List

In 2022, I rebranded, and as part of that I created an entirely new client guide, which includes my vendor referral list. Not only did I revamp that whole list so that 95% of the folks identify with underrepresented groups in the industry, I also made it easy for clients to identify those vendors so they could more easily find folks they identify and feel represent them and/or their values. This is still the vendor referral list I used in 2023, with only a couple of updates due to folks closing shop, or in order for me to swap out some recommendations to make the list even more representative.

### ‚úÖ Networking Events Focused on and/or Hosted by Underrepresented Groups

I reset this goal last year to be just one networking event, and that made it achievable for me in 2023. Again, low revenue meant that I didn‚Äôt have many funds to spend on events or travel, so the only networking event I attended was an Altared event. Altared‚Äôs whole purpose is to address and make better issues of diversity and inclusion in the wedding industry, so this goal was achieved this year.

### üü° 50% Advertising Spend with Organizations that Prove a Commitment to D+I as a public part of their business practices

I updated this last year to focus on ‚Äúdirectory advertising‚Äù spend, and that helped, but I still missed the mark here for 2023. This is primarily because some spots opened up on Wandering Weddings, which is the biggest resource specifically for couples looking to have an adventure elopement, and getting into their directory as a featured vendor had been a huge priority for me for years. When a spot opened for both Oregon and Washington (and then later in the year, Idaho), I took them immediately, as this directory is hugely beneficial for visibility and SEO in reaching my target audience. 

That said, while Wandering Weddings has a brief note on their ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù page regarding inclusive practices, that‚Äôs about it; so, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be fair to say that this counts as an organization that has a ‚Äúproven commitment‚Äù to D+I.

Being featured on Wandering Weddings is something that I will continue to prioritize as the ROI is undeniable and, at this point, pretty vital to my bookings. However, it also takes up over 70% of my annual advertising budget. This leads me to the conclusion that I need to update this goal to something that allows me to do what is best for my business (ie advertising in places that give me the best possible return on investment), while also finding ways to support organizations that are making D+I more forefront in their business practices.

## Summary

In 2023, I achieved about 50% of my D+I goals (removing from the equation the goal of ensuring a D+I policy was in place for any workshops or styled shoots, since I didn‚Äôt actually attend any such events in 2023). This is better than 2022, but it‚Äôs become very clear that it‚Äôs time for a policy and goals update. The items that I wasn‚Äôt able to achieve proved to be poor estimations of what I could actually do (while also still challenging myself), and in some cases, would require poor business choices to achieve (e.g. pulling out from certain advertisers that are resulting in significant percentages of my overall bookings). As such, I will be re-assessing ALL of the goals outline in my D+I policy for 2024 to make them more realistic (but not necessarily easy - I will still aim to push myself to be better through these goals). I‚Äôm excited to jump into 2024 with a fresh outlook on ways that I can hold myself accountable and create new opportunities for incorporating D+I work and awareness into Venture Ever After.
