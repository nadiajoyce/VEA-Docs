## ðŸŸ¡ Monthly Social Audits

In 2022, I achieved very quick and dirty audits of my social feeds for the first quarter. Like last year, these probably were not deep enough dives to begin with, and I stopped doing them entirely after March - which is also when I launched a complete rebrand. Post-rebrand I was suddenly in survival mode, with a huge break in the overall economy (the whole industry got hit really hard), and some incredibly harsh personal medical challenges that lasted the entirety of the rest of the year (and are still ongoing). Basically, my priorities were to stay above water, in more than one way, and regular audits of all kinds fell to the wayside. That all said, Iâ€™m also realizing that this way of doing audits is clearly not sustainable or practical for me. I need to figure out a new way to keep myself accountable and aware that will work, even when times are tough. I look forward to revamping this process in 2023.

## ðŸŸ¡ Quarterly Website Audits

Similar to the monthly social audits, quarterly website audits largely just didnâ€™t really happen in 2022. Q1 got an audit, but it was largely because my new site launched and those checks were part of the process anyway. This is another area I aim to improve in 2023, and also recognize needs to be more manageable and sustainable.

## ðŸŸ¡ Interviewing of Second Shooters + Other Subcontractors

In 2020, I created a questionnaire that all second shooters that work with me would have to fill out moving forward. In 2022, I continued making sure this was part of my process for onboarding new second shooters, of which I did have a few in 2022. All folks completed and passed the questionnaire before I worked with them.

However, where I dropped the ball on this goal is with other subcontractors, namely my editors. Once again, I worked with Edited by Artists for a large part of the year, but once again, I also failed to inquire into their own D+I practices or standards. Iâ€™m not currently working with an editor in 2023, but should I decide to, I plan to put into place a reminder to check in about this with them. This was a matter of simply forgetting, which is not a good enough excuse at all.

## âœ… Contract Clause

All VEA contracts (wedding, event, portrait, second shooter, etc) still include a clause which states:

_In the event that Photographer identifies any inappropriate, threatening, hostile, racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, misogynistic, or otherwise hateful or offensive behavior directed at them or their employees, contractors, agents, or other, Photographer reserves the right to end photography, retain all fees paid by the Client, and hold no further responsibilities to the Client._

_Photographer agrees to notify the Client of any of the above listed behaviors, and give them an opportunity to correct such behaviors, or remove the offending individuals from the session prior to ending photography_

## ðŸŸ¡ Two Paid Workshops a Year

In 2022, I attended a single in-person workshop put on by Altared (whose whole existence and goal is focused on D+I work in the wedding industry). Given my survival mode for the year, this was the only workshop I attended at all, all year, and it happened at the very end in December. Iâ€™ve already signed up for a few Altared classes in 2023 and plan to attend at least 3. None of these are paid, but often the educators offer their Venmo, and I plan to contribute in that way.

## âœ… Inclusive Practices for Workshops, Styled Shoots, etc

Again, the only workshop I attended in 2022 was the Altared in-person one in December. Altared, by its very nature, has very inclusive practices and always go above and beyond to ensure safe, welcoming spaces for everyone.

## âœ… Vendor Referral List

In 2022, I rebranded, and as part of that I created an entirely new client guide, which includes my vendor referral list. Not only did I revamp that whole list so that 95% of the folks identify with underrepresented groups in the industry, I also made it easy for clients to identify those vendors so they could more easily find folks they identify and feel represent them and/or their values.

## ðŸŸ¡ Networking Events Focused on and/or Hosted by Underrepresented Groups

My policy sets this goal at 2 a year, and I only attended one. Again, the December Altared workshop is doing a lot of the heavy lifting for me this year, and itâ€™s the only event that I can rightfully count for this goal. In 2023, I would very much like to meet this goal, especially since more in-person events are occurring now. 

## âœ… 50% Advertising Spend with Organizations that Prove a Commitment to D+I as a public part of their business practices

Like last year, I technically achieved this goal in 2022, because The Knot has done a lot of work to focus more on D+I issues in the industry. I also spent a percentage of my advertising dollars with Equally Wed. I reduced my overall advertising spend quite a bit in 2022, and have done so even more in 2023 by dropping The Knot completely. I hope to redisperse those advertising dollars that I wonâ€™t be using on Google Ads to places that are focused on underrepresented groups (am currently looking into Offbeat Wed, Rainbow Wedding Network, Portland Gay Pages, and others). In general, I suppose it would be more accurate to update this goal as spending 50%+ of my *directory* advertising dollars with organizations focused on underrepresented groups, as I donâ€™t think itâ€™s realistic or the best business move to ignore the fact that spending significant chunks of my advertising dollars on Google Ads is the best way to grow in this way.

---


In 2022, I achieved about 44% of my D+I goals. This is better than 2021, but not good enough. It was, indeed, another unprecedented year in terms of a terrible economy (which hit industries like weddings/elopements particularly hard), and I have been dealing with some incredibly challenging personal struggles as well. However, I donâ€™t want this to become a pattern, and two years in a row of these low of numbers is not a trend I want to continue. I plan to reassess my D+I policy to make it more realistic, while still challenging myself to be better overall, and I will be working on better systems to ensure I can achieve those goals, even when times are tough.
