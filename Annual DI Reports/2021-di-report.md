## Analysis + Steps Forward

🟡 **Monthly Social Audits**

In 2021, I achieved very quick and dirty audits of my social feeds for about the first 4-5 months. These honestly were probably not deep enough dives to begin with, and I stopped doing them entirely around May/June. This is largely due to an unprecedentedly busy year. Most of my admin tasks were put on the back burner, including audits, just so I could keep up with the number of shoots and editing this past year. This was not a situation unique to me; the entire industry felt the pressure of backlogged work due to COVID. That said, it’s important that - now that I’ve identified how to NOT have a year like 2021 ever again - I rededicate myself to doing monthly social audits as a regular part of my workflow.

🟡 **Quarterly Website Audits**

Similar to the monthly social audits, quarterly website audits largely just didn’t happen in 2021. Q1 got an audit, but it was light, and given that I had recently updated my site, there wasn’t much to report. This is another area I aim to improve in 2022, especially considering that I’ll be launching an entirely new brand and website in Q1.

🟡 **Interviewing of Second Shooters + Other Subcontractors**

In 2020, I created a questionnaire that all second shooters that work with NJP would have to fill out moving forward. I continued making sure this was part of my process for onboarding new second shooters - 2 of which I had in 2021. Both those folks completed and passed the questionnaire before I worked with them.

However, where I dropped the ball on this goal is with other subcontractors, namely my editors. I had two this year, neither of which I asked any D+I related questions, nor did I investigate their existing websites/content to identify D+I policies. This was largely due to an overwhelming amount of editing that needed to be done throughout pretty much the entire year; by the time I was contracting these folks to help me, I couldn’t take the time to step back, slow down, and vet them first. That said, one of the editors I worked with, I’ve worked with shooting in the past and I know to be an individual with values aligned with the NJP brand. The second editor I’ve started working with, I need to do some more learning about to ensure this goal is being met, but I’m confident they have strong D+I practices. That said, this goal in 2022 can only be met when I do my due diligence in this area, as well as with any other subcontractors I may hire moving forward.

✅ **Contract Clause**

All NJP contracts (wedding, event, portrait, second shooter, etc) still include a clause which states:

> In the event that Photographer identifies any inappropriate, threatening, hostile, racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, misogynistic, or otherwise hateful or offensive behavior directed at them or their employees, contractors, agents, or other, Photographer reserves the right to end photography, retain all fees paid by the Client, and hold no further responsibilities to the Client.

> Photographer agrees to notify the Client of any of the above listed behaviors, and give them an opportunity to correct such behaviors, or remove the offending individuals from the session prior to ending photography

✅ **Two Paid Workshops a Year**

In 2021, I attended three workshops focused on social justice and making the wedding industry more inclusive (all hosted by Altared): “Make your wedding website more inclusive”, “How to identify and disrupt inherent bias”, and “Accessibility in the wedding industry: Your role as a vendor”. At the end of last year, I stated that I wanted to “to continue achieving this goal, but want to update the wording of my D+I Policy from just saying “Two PAID workshops a year” to something that more directly commits me to attending two workshops a year that focus on and/or are hosted by those who are negatively impacted by the wedding industry as it stands.” I achieved this in 2021, and going into 2022, would like to keep up doing this kind of work, as it has significantly and directly impacted how I’m running my business (and in particular in the coming year, how I’ve built and modeled my new brand).

✅ **Inclusive Practices for Workshops, Styled Shoots, etc**

In 2021, much like 2020,  there was very little opportunity for workshops and styled shoots, because COVID prevented us from gathering. I did coordinate my own styled shoot in collaboration with a local florist, Hyacinth Orange, and made sure there was a focus on bringing in underrepresented vendors. That said, I’m hoping that 2022 offers more opportunities for workshops and styled shoots, and should I attend any, I will be seeking out opportunities to participate in events that are focused on D+I in the wedding and elopement industry. 

🟡 **Vendor Referral List**

My D+I policy calls for keeping a vendor referral list that achieves at least 50% representation of underrepresented folx (BIPOC, LGBTQ+, woman-owned, etc). In 2021, again much like 2020, I admittedly barely looked at my vendor referral list. 2021 was the most intense year of my career, and I was constantly just trying to keep up with the amount of work I had. I did make lots of connections with new vendors I didn’t have before, many of whom belong to underrepresented groups in the industry. However, I have yet to update my official referral list. In 2022, with my rebrand, I will be updating this list and aiming to finally achieve this goal.

🟡 **Networking Events Focused on and/or Hosted by Underrepresented Groups**

In 2021, there wasn’t much in the way of networking events, as COVID still kept folks from gathering too much. There were some virtual events, and arguably, some of the workshops I attended sort of worked towards this goal, but I didn’t attend any events in 2020 that were specifically “networking” events. 

In 2022, I’m going to make this goal a little more realistic, considering that COVID is still a thing, and I’m also in a transition with my rebrand, and aim to attend at least 1 networking event, probably virtually. 

✅ **50% Advertising Spend with Organizations that Prove a Commitment to D+I as a public part of their business practices**

I technically achieved this goal this year, because The Knot has done a lot of work to focus more on D+I issues in the industry. However, I still think there’s a lot of opportunity to work more with organizations that have a deeper and stronger focus on D+I in the industry, and I’d like to allocate more funds to those places. I’m getting closer, but still not there yet. I still feel a reliance on The Knot for a big chunk of my revenue, and so have been hesitant to pull those funds back to spend them elsewhere. However, with my rebrand, I did reduce my spend with The Knot at the end of 2021, which frees up some funds to spend in other places. I will maintain my spend with Equally Wed, and seek out other acute opportunities like the one with Ringed for their giveaway to an LGBTQIA+ couple, but I also would like to start spending advertising funds with Offbeat Bride and continue to investigate and find other resources that focus on outreach to underrepresented folks in the industry.

## Summary
In 2021, I only achieved about 35% of my D+I policy goals. This was an unprecedented year in terms of volume of work (for the entire industry), and I was very much in survival mode for the majority of the year. That said, I learned a LOT, and have done a lot of work to ensure that 2022 is more balanced and manageable. A huge priority for me in the coming year is to re-focus efforts in D+I work in my business, including making D+I practices and even more visible and foundational part of my business model with my new brand. There’s a lot of work I need to do still, a lot of room for improvement, and I’m very excited to tackle these goals in 2022.
