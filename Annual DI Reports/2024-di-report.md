### Goals Achieved ‚úÖ:
- Social media audits of content
- Client contracts to all include an Event Behavior and Liability clause
- Minimum one workshop a year that‚Äôs focused on D+I topics, either inside or outside the wedding industry (took The Oath)
- Before participation in any styled shoots, workshops, or other events, inquire into their own D+I policies
- At least once a year, attend networking events focused on and/or hosted by underrepresented groups in order to connect with even more folks working in the wedding industry (Altared in October)
- Maintaining a vendor referral list that is made up of at least 50% underrepresented folks
- Vet all directory advertising organizations to which I give my money to ensure D+I policies are in place and that there's alignment with Venture Ever After's core values (Zola, WW, EW)
- Maintain a presence in at least 2 directories that are specifically focused on reaching underrepresented marriers (EIQ, Equally Wed)
- For every wedding or elopement booking that Venture Ever After receives, I will donate a set amount of money (as of 2024: $200) to a select organization doing work in human rights, environmental issues, or both
- Annually assess the organizations on my Giving Back Program list to ensure they're still doing work that aligns with Venture Ever After's values, and I will rotate in new organizations whenever possible, to give others a chance at receiving benefits of the program.

### üü° Annual Website Audits

In 2024, I did some updating to the VEA website, but it was mostly focused on SEO and new marketing pages (e.g. album offerings). While I did swap in some new imagery, and intentionally looked at representation as part of my image choices for the site, I did not conduct any audit of the website that was specifically focused on D+I. 

In general, website updates have proven difficult for me, for a number of reasons. In 2025, I have plans to reduce my focus and time on social media, specifically in an effort to spend more time on my website and direct-to-client communications. As part of this, I will be including D+I efforts. This will hopefully result in two positive changes: 1) Higher quality connections with clients and potential clients, and 2) More time and energy available to me so that I can focus on connecting in more meaningful ways, which includes a focus on inclusivity and telling the stories of underrepresented folks more in-depth.

### ‚úÖ Social Media Audits

While I never established a formulaic or consistent schedule for this in 2024, I did regularly (approx once every 3-4 months) check in on my socials to assess what content I was sharing, who was represented in it, how often, and where. Inclusive language remained a priority, and was consistently used. I think where this may have fallen short this past year is in representation in imagery - in 2024 I had fewer than normal new clients belonging to underrepresented groups, and because I was using my social channels primarily to post sneak previews of current client events, that meant that my feeds largely appeared to be populated by more heteronormative relationships in general. So, while I achieved a goal of checking in on these things regularly, I want to improve upon actions taken based on those audits in 2025.

As mentioned above, I do plan to take a step back on social media in general to focus more on newsletters and my website. This may mean I‚Äôm posting less in general. However, I think it will be important to be more mindful of what I do post. Rather than only using my social feeds for sneak preview imagery of current clients, I aim to create more content that‚Äôs educational and/or values driven, and the images used for that content should include more underrepresented individuals and relationships.

### ‚ö™ Interviewing of Second Shooters + Other Subcontractors

I didn‚Äôt end up working with any new subcontractors this year. The second shooter/associate I worked with was Cassidy, who I‚Äôve been working with for years, and became an official part of the VEA team in late 2023. She completed the D+I questionnaire previously, and also signed a new contract as an associate that included a D+I clause. So, this goal simply didn‚Äôt change/apply in 2024.

### ‚úÖ Contract Clause

All VEA contracts (wedding, event, portrait, second shooter, etc) still include a clause which states:

_In the event that Photographer identifies any inappropriate, threatening, hostile, racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, misogynistic, or otherwise hateful or offensive behavior directed at them or their employees, contractors, agents, or other, Photographer reserves the right to end photography, retain all fees paid by the Client, and hold no further responsibilities to the Client._

_Photographer agrees to notify the Client of any of the above listed behaviors, and give them an opportunity to correct such behaviors, or remove the offending individuals from the session prior to ending photography_

### ‚úÖ One Workshop a Year Focused on D+I Topics

Early in 2024, I added The Outdoorist Oath to the organizations that will benefit from my Giving Back Program. Before bringing them on, I wanted to actually experience their program, which is focused on educating people not only about Leave No Trace-type topics (e.g. being good stewards for outdoor spaces), but also on inclusivity and belonging on outdoor spaces. I successfully attended a workshop and took The Oath, which fulfills this goal for the year.

In 2025, I would like to keep this goal of at least one workshop a year devoted to this topic.

### ‚úÖ Inclusive Practices for Workshops, Styled Shoots, etc

The only workshop I attended this year was The Outdoorist Oath workshop, which was in and of itself devoted to D+I topics. They explicitly state their [commitments on their website](https://www.outdooristoath.org/about), as well.

### ‚úÖ Networking Events Focused on and/or Hosted by Underrepresented Groups

Similar to 2023, the only networking event I attended in 2024 was an Altared event. Altared‚Äôs whole purpose is to address and make better issues of diversity and inclusion in the wedding industry, so this goal was achieved this year.

In 2025, I will largely keep this goal the same, but I would like to challenge myself to attend a networking event that meets this but isn‚Äôt hosted by Altared.

### ‚úÖ Vendor Referral List

In 2022, I rebranded, and as part of that I created an entirely new client guide, which includes my vendor referral list. Not only did I revamp that whole list so that 95% of the folks identify with underrepresented groups in the industry, I also made it easy for clients to identify those vendors so they could more easily find folks they identify and feel represent them and/or their values. This is still the vendor referral list I used in 2024, with only a couple of updates due to folks closing shop, or in order for me to swap out some recommendations to make the list even more representative.

### ‚úÖ Vet All Directory Advertising Organizations to Which I Give my Money to Ensure D+I Policies are in Place

I updated this from last year to ensure it made it possible for me to realistically achieve the goal, without having to drop advertisers that are vital to my annual revenue goals. This helped a lot, and I‚Äôm happy to say that I was able to achieve this goal in 2024.

The three directories that I paid to be present in in 2024 were Zola, Wandering Weddings, and Equally Wed. Zola is very public about their commitment to D+I and have an active policy, as well as workflow for requiring vendors listed on their site to commit to D+I practices as well. Wandering Weddings still could improve on their visibility of D+I, and don‚Äôt seem to have any ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù in place, but they do have an explicit statement about their [‚ÄúCommitment to Equality‚Äù](https://wanderingweddings.com/about-wandering-weddings/) on their website. Equally Wed is specifically geared towards underrepresented groups, and D+I is at the forefront of their product.

### ‚úÖ Maintain a Presence in at Least 2 Directories that are Specifically Focused on Reaching Underrepresented Marriers

This was a new approach after my D+I policy audit last year, and I‚Äôm really excited to have met this goal! I maintained a presence on both Equally Wed and Everywhere is Queer (EIQ). The former is a paid listing, and the latter is free. However, I aim to engage in some paid advertising with EIQ in 2025.

### ‚úÖ Giving Back Program

I maintained my Giving Back Program in 2024 (for every wedding or elopement booking that Venture Ever After receives, I will donate a set amount of money (as of 2024: $200) to a select organization doing work in human rights, environmental issues, or both). The total donated for 2024 was $2200!

I also spent some time assessing the organizations that receive donations from the Giving Back Program. While I decided not to make any changes to which organizations are included for 2025, I am considering changing up how those donations are dispersed. Right now, clients get to choose which organization benefits when they book; however, I‚Äôve found that certain organizations are receiving a much larger percentage of Venture Ever After donations as a result - and some aren‚Äôt receiving any at all. I would like to make sure that all the organizations that are part of the program are receiving donations each year, so I will be experimenting with removing the client choice of organization and just dispersing funds quarterly, evenly across organizations - or some variation of this.

## Summary

In 2024, I achieved about 91% of my D+I goals (removing from the equation the goal of interviewing any new contractors re: their D+I policies because I didn‚Äôt hire any new contractors in 2024). This is MUCH better than all previous years, which is exciting to see.

That said, now that I‚Äôve had a year to use these new goals as implemented at the end of 2023, I wonder if I may have overcorrected on a few goals, making it much too easy to achieve all of these. Many felt that they just inherently happened due to long-established business practices. I feel I need to challenge myself a bit more in 2025 for these goals to remain meaningful.

I‚Äôm excited to come back around and re-assess these goals again, aiming to come to a good middle ground between the adjustments I made last year and the goals I had previously that proved unrealistic/unattainable in the long run. My 2025 policies and goals will reflect an effort to challenge myself, while balancing business and revenue-focused goals so that I can ensure I‚Äôm keeping values forefront, but also allowing myself the ability to make smart business decisions for long-term success.
