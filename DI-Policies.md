# Statement

Historically, the wedding industry has been massively lacking in areas of representation and equity, especially across race, gender, and sexual orientation. The fact that interracial marriage wasn’t fully legal in the U.S. until 1967, and same sex marriage wasn’t legal until 2015, has been reflected in wedding industry practices and imagery since its beginning. And to this day, it’s painfully clear just how racist, sexist, homophobic, and generally prejudiced the industry still is.

It’s up to wedding vendors and industry leaders to correct this. We have a responsibility to create spaces and content where all people feel seen, safe, and valued. 

It’s important to me as a wedding business owner to not only implement policies that address these issues, but also hold myself accountable to those policies. So, I’m sharing this document publicly as one part of my own efforts to do better and be better. This not an “arrival”, but rather part of an ongoing process that will evolve and change over the lifetime of my business as I learn and iterate to create more inclusive, welcoming, and safe spaces for all folx.

# Specific policies

These are the specific actions I commit to taking as integral parts of how I do business moving forward. 

+ Listening + amplifying

   + Listen to and amplify the stories and experiences of marginalized groups in the industry, and out of it.
      + Examples include, but are not limited to:
         + Promotion of diversity-and-inclusion-minded vendors in my social feeds and blog
         + Sharing love stories from underrepresented folx in my social feeds and blog

   + Use my privilege, and speak up when witness to problematic statements, situations, and practices.

   + Own my own mistakes when - not if - I make them, make reparations, and do better next time.

+ Regular audits of website and social media feeds

   + Quarterly for website:
      + Ensure representation of underrepresented groups in imagery across website, including blog
      + Ensure the use of inclusive language (e.g. gender neutral terms) across website, including blog
      + Ensure Diversity + Inclusion (D+I) Policies are up-to-date and accurate based on ongoing work and evolving best practices

   + Monthly for social:
      + Ensure representation of underrepresented groups in feeds, across all platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest)
      + Ensure the use of inclusive language extends to all social posts

+ Subcontractors, partners, + clients

   + Interview second shooters, editors, and any others I work with/for to ensure inclusive practices and the comfort/safety of all my clients.
      + Questions subcontractors + business partners will be expected to answer include:
         + What are the D+I policies for your own business? Do you have them written down? Can you share them with me?
         + In what ways do you show support and acceptance for love and partners of all kinds, including folks belonging to the LGBTQIA+ community and interracial couples?
         + Have you ever refused service to a couple because their partnership conflicted with your personal values?
         + If someone were to make a racist remark while you were working with them, what would you do?

+ Continuing education 

   + Minimum two PAID workshops a year (pay marginalized individuals for their work).

   + Before participation in any styled shoots, workshops, or other events, inquire into their own D+I policies. 
      + If D+I policies are nonexistent or do not align with NJP's own values on the topic, I will start a conversation to recommend the addition or amendment of a set of D+I policies. If efforts are not made to implement or amend said policies, I will not participate in, promote, or financially support the event.

+ Networking + referrals

   + Regularly and consistently seek out, work with, and refer underrepresented vendors. This includes:
      + Creating (year 2020) and maintaining (ongoing) a vendor referral list that is made up of 50% underrepresented folx.
      + At least twice a year, attend networking events focused on and/or hosted by underrepresented groups in order to connect with even more folx working in the wedding industry.

+ Advertising spend + outreach

   + Spend at least 25% advertising dollars with sites, publications, and organizations that are focused on social justice and equity in the wedding industry.
   + Vet advertising/directory organizations to which I give my money to ensure D+I policies are in place and that there's alignment with NJP's core values.


I also commit to updating these policies as I learn and as the industry changes. 

I’m one person, one very small business, in this massive ever-growing industry, but that doesn’t make my responsibility any less. These are the promises I make to my clients, fellow vendors, and anyone who may be affected by my work.
