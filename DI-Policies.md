# Statement

Historically, the wedding industry has been massively lacking in areas of representation and equity, especially across race, gender, and sexual orientation. The fact that interracial marriage wasn’t fully legal in the U.S. until 1967, and same sex marriage wasn’t legal until 2015, has been reflected in wedding industry practices and imagery since its beginning. And to this day, it’s painfully clear just how racist, sexist, homophobic, and generally prejudiced the industry still is. In 2025, it's clear that there will likely be even more challenges to Diversity and Inclusion, not only in the wedding industry, but throughout the U.S.'s society.

When it comes to the wedding industry, it’s up to wedding vendors and industry leaders to correct this. We have a responsibility to create spaces and content where all people feel seen, welcome, celebrated, and valued. Now more than ever.

It’s important to me as a wedding business owner to not only implement policies that address these issues, but also hold myself accountable to those policies. So, I’m sharing this document publicly as one part of my own efforts to do better and be better. This is not an “arrival”, but rather part of an ongoing process that will evolve and change over the lifetime of my business as I learn and iterate to create more inclusive, welcoming, and celebratory spaces for all people.

# Specific policies

These are the specific actions I commit to taking as integral parts of how I do business moving forward. 


+ Listening + amplifying

   + Listen to and amplify the stories and experiences of marginalized groups in the industry, and out of it.
      + Examples include, but are not limited to:
         + Promotion of diversity-and-inclusion-minded vendors in my social feeds, blog, and newsletters
         + Sharing love stories from underrepresented folks in my social feeds, blog, and newsletters

   + Use my privilege, and speak up when witness to problematic statements, situations, and practices.

   + Own my own mistakes when I make them, make reparations, and do better next time.


+ Website updates

   + When conducting website updates (at least once a year):
      + Ensure representation of underrepresented groups in imagery across website, including blog
      + Ensure the use of inclusive language (e.g. gender neutral terms) across website, including blog
      + Ensure Diversity + Inclusion (D+I) Policies are up-to-date and accurate based on ongoing work and evolving best practices


+ Social media
  
   + Quarterly audit feeds to ensure representation of underrepresented groups across all platforms (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Pinterest)
   + Ensure the use of inclusive language extends to all social posts


+ Subcontractors, partners, + clients

   + Interview second shooters, editors, and others I work with/for to ensure inclusive practices and the comfort/safety of my clients.
      + Questions subcontractors + business partners will be expected to answer include:
         + What are the D+I policies for your own business? Do you have them written down? Can you share them with me?
         + In what ways do you show support and acceptance for love and partners of all kinds, including folks belonging to the LGBTQIA+ community and interracial couples?
         + Have you ever refused service to a couple because their partnership conflicted with your personal values?
         + If someone were to make a racist remark while you were working with them, what would you do?
   + Client contracts to all include an Event Behavior and Liability clause, which states:
      >In the event that Photographer identifies any inappropriate, threatening, hostile, racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, misogynistic, or otherwise hateful or offensive behavior directed at them or their employees, contractors, agents, or other, Photographer reserves the right to end photographing of the event, retain all fees paid by the Client, and hold no further responsibilities to the Client.


      >Photographer agrees to notify the Client of any of the above listed behaviors, and give them an opportunity to correct such behaviors, or remove the offending individuals from the venue prior to ending event photographing.


+ Continuing education 

   + Minimum one workshop a year that's focused on D+I topics, either inside or outside the wedding industry.

   + Before participation in any styled shoots, workshops, or other events, inquire into their own D+I policies. 
      + If D+I policies are nonexistent or do not align with Venture Ever After's own values on the topic, I will start a conversation to recommend the addition of or amendment to a set of D+I policies. If efforts are not made to implement or amend said policies, I will not participate in, promote, or financially support the event.
    

+ Networking + referrals

   + Regularly and consistently seek out, work with, and refer underrepresented vendors. This includes:
      + Maintaining a vendor referral list that is made up of at least 50% underrepresented folks.
      + At least once a year, attend networking events focused on and/or hosted by underrepresented groups in order to connect with even more people working in the wedding industry. At least one of these should be outside of what's offered by [Altared](https://altaredpdx.com/).


+ Advertising spend + outreach

   + Vet all directory advertising organizations to which I give my money to ensure D+I policies are in place and that there's alignment with Venture Ever After's core values.
   + Maintain a presence in at least 2 directories that are specifically focused on reaching underrepresented marriers (e.g. LGBTQIA+ folks).

 
+ Giving Back Program

   + For every wedding or elopement booking that Venture Ever After receives, I will donate a set amount of money (as of 2025: $200) to a select organization doing work in human rights, environmental issues, or both.
   + I will annually assess the organizations on my Giving Back Program list to ensure they're still doing work that aligns with Venture Ever After's values, and I will rotate in new organizations whenever possible, to give others a chance at receiving benefits of the program.


I also commit to updating these policies as I learn and as the industry changes. 

I’m one person, one very small business, in this massive ever-growing-and-changing industry, but that doesn’t make my responsibility any less. These are the promises I make to my clients, fellow vendors, and anyone who may be affected by my work. 

Thank you for reading, and if you have any concerns, suggestions, or other comments, please don’t hesitate to reach out to nadia@ventureeverafter.com.
